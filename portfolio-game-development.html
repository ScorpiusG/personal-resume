The player character can perform various actions for use in combat. It can be played with either the controller, or mouse and keyboard.</p></li>

                <li><p>My <span class="text-bold">first music rhythm game project</span> independently designed and programmed entirely by me with Unity 5. Made within three months from scratch starting from January 2015, publicly released at the end of March 2015. The game involved using both the keyboard and the mouse. All audio included has also been made by me using Music Creator 6 Touch. Simple and minimalistic art was done using Paint.NET.</p></li>

                </ul>
                <li><p>My <span class="text-bold">other unreleased music rhythm game project</span> that has improved since the first one above, and as well as several others between then and this one since July 2022. The game would be made compatible for most current platforms; which is designed suitably for keyboard, controller, and touchscreen. The foundations of this project has been done in Unity 2021. The gameplay perspective is 3D, with mostly 2D sprites. The rest of the game (menus) will be in 2D. The game currently lacks visuals and a soundtrack (licensed) to progress further.</p></li>

                <li><p><span class="text-bold">KDU Fantasy - The Cosmic Chronicles</span>, an RPG in a post-apocalyptic setting made with RPG Maker VX Ace. The game was an independent side-project developed by me; and it has started its production since mid-2013, with the latest version out on late-2013. The game would involve me, my semester’s batch, and the player character to team up, explore KDU DJ campus, and fight enemies opposing the player party. The player would also need to investigate the causes behind the disasters that followed the world’s apocalypse. Sadly, this game is also incomplete and is playable up to three chapters. This game was also a first and a practice for me in regards to business sales. 50 physical copies were printed on CDs in traditional disc covers, and all of them sold during Comic Fiesta 2013 in KLCC.</p></li>
